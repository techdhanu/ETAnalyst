## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ETAnalyst.git
   cd ETAnalyst

### Notes:
1. **Placeholder for Repository URL**:
   - Replace `https://github.com/your-username/ETAnalyst.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.

2. **Virtual Environment Instructions**:
   - Added platform-specific commands for creating and activating a virtual environment (venv) to ensure users set up an isolated environment.

3. **Requirements File**:
   - The `pip install -r requirements.txt` command assumes you have a `requirements.txt` file in your repository listing dependencies (e.g., `streamlit`, `pandas`, `requests`, `folium`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).


4. **Formatting**:
- Used code blocks (```bash) for commands to ensure they are displayed as executable code in GitHub.
- Added a note in italics (*Note:*) to emphasize the venv usage.

This `README.md` will now guide users to clone the repo, set up a virtual environment, and install dependencies, while preserving the "About Us" content. Let me know if you need further tweaks!
